- DataTransferObjects: Objects which are used for outside communication via the API.
- Service: Implements the business logic and handles the generation of cron expression.

#### How to use the application
You should be able to start the application by executing CronExpressionGeneratorApplication(A java Class),which starts a webserver on port 8080 (http://localhost:8080).

 You can use these webservices for generating cron expression according to your need.
 
 You can use the below cronMaker application to verify your cron expression,I also created these webservices by the help of the below given application.
##### [CronMaker](http://www.cronmaker.com/;jsessionid=node061q9kt7um7hq1jpxqp2hr24de1241044.node0?0 "CronMaker")
You can test these webservices through Postman(A testing tool for testing Rest based webservices).
